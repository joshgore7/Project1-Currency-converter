It uses a currency exchange API to retrieve real-time exchange rates and displays the converted amount based on user input.

## Problems and Planning

<h3>Problem Statement:</h3> 
I was watching Squid Games and I kept wondering how significant the money was in US Dollars

<h3>User Stories:</h3> 
As a user, I want to select my source and target currencies from dropdowns, so that I can convert from one currency to another.

As a user, I want to enter an amount in the source currency, so that I can see the converted amount in the target currency.

As a user, I want the app to support a wide range of currencies, so that I can convert between many different currencies.

As a user, I want the app to display flags for each currency, so that I can visually identify the currencies.
